Snake
=====

Snake is yet another Make-like tool, written on Python and inspired by Rake.


Usage Example
=============

In a directory with ``snakefile.py`` containing such code::

    from snake.api import *

    @task
    def hello():
        print("Hello World!")

    task('default').needs(hello)

one could run::

    $ snake hello
    Hello World!

or (because ``default`` task is executed if no other task name was specified)::

    $ snake
    Hello World!
